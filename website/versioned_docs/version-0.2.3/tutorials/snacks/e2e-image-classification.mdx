In this tutorial, you will create a simple, yet efficient image classification app from end to end. You will start with the project setup, go through choosing and optimizing your dataset, and through training and benchmarking your machine learning model. Finally, you'll see your model in action in the PlayTorch app.

You will also learn powerful tips and tricks for dataset and model training optimization that will result in more accurate image classification. These tips and tricks are universal.
